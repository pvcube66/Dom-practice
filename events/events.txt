there are various types of events:mouse, keyboard etc
when the user clicks on something, then we can trigger something.

1. onclick()
2.ondblclick()
we donot want to do this way its kinda ugly, the other way is 

1. one idea is to just add in the html itself, uglyg it is
    <h1 id="hii" onclick="hi()">Adding Event Listeners</h1>


2. the better is to select the element and add stuff in the js file:
  const temp=document.querySelector('.card');
  temp.onclick=bye;

3. the optimal one is to use the eventlistener
  first argument is which will trigger it, second argument is what will happen when it gets triggered
  we can adad multiple events while using the eventlistener, where as the onclick will overwrite the above functions
  const temp=document.querySelector('.card');
  temp.addEventListener('click',bye);
